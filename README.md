# CapacityAllocation

This git-repository contains all code developed by Johanne Juul Iversen (s174308) during her master thesis at DTU in 2022-2023. The jupyter notebook "Model_epsilon" summarizes the code for the developed capacity allocation model.

If the reader is interested in the actual code one must look in the folder "BackBone" where different subfolders contains libraries with different functionalities. A configuration file controls the paths and methods in the libraries "tools" and "model" - the configuration file must be configured using the "preprocessing" library for the code to work. The libraries "model" and "tools" contains the python code in which implementation of the models and implementation of the algorithms created to calculate relevant robustness metrics are found.
